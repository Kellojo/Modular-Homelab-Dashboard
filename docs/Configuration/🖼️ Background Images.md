# Background Images

You can set custom background images for your dashboard to enhance its visual appeal. Background images can be configured in the main configuration file under the `config > background` section.

```yaml
config:
  background:
    # Path to the background image
    url: ./background.jpg

    # Amount of blur to apply to the background, set to 0 for no blur
    blur: 0.5rem

    # Amount of brightness to apply to the background, set to 1 for no change
    brightness: 0.25
```
