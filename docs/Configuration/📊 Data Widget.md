# Data Widget

Displays a tile that contains dynamic data. This widget is useful for displaying information that should be pulled from an external source via a built-in integration/plugin. This widget requires additional configuration depending on the data source being used and the type of data being displayed.

By default the data will be refreshed every 10 seconds and a history of up to 100 entries will be kept for plugins that support historical data.
