# Modular Homelab Dashboard
This project is a modular dashboard designed for managing and monitoring a homelab environment. It provides a customizable interface to display various metrics, system statuses, and other relevant information about your homelab.

All configured in a simple yaml file with a backend to securely fetch data from your homelab services, without exposing credentials/API keys to the frontend.
